goals for this project

* trin tracker (just track trinity and know when she looks and what shhes most interested in) >> GOOD PROMETHEUS METRICS
* song pushing (kinda crud like, yt music clients push to the db ONLY THROUGH DEVIN'S UUID) >> GOOD CURD INFRA
* song fetching (most recent...50 songs? only devin and trin can fetch this based on their uuid) >> SAME HERE




LATER ONNN
* websocket showing currently listneing to!


so for pushing, when post request comes in, devin's token for authorization is added and if it matches devin's known uuid >>
it gets pushed

for getting same concept for but GET requets and for trin and devin's known uuid's
